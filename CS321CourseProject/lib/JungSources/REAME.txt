If you want to use the source code in the jar as an example of what to do then you have

to attach it to its corresponding binary jar.

in eclipse you may do this by following these steps
	1): Navigating to the Build Path of the project
	2): Navigate to the Libraries tab
	3): Find the binary jar you want to attach the source too(i.e: jung-samples-2.0.1.jar)
	4): click the drop down arrow and select Source attachment of that jar
	5): Navigate & select it's corresponding source jar found in this folder (i.e: jung-samples-2.0.1-sources.jar)
	6): Apply & Close and you are good to go!
jung-samples-2.0.1-sources.jar will be attached to jung-samples-2.0.1.jar

Repeat these steps for all files that you may want to look at
