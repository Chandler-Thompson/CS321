# Mason Maze Finder 
Helping students and visitors to George Mason Fairfax find there way around campus.

## What is this?
This is a semester project for GMU CS 321. This application generates "shorest paths" between user-specified points on the George Mason University Fairfax Campus.

This was inspired by the navigation difficulties imposed by the construction projects occurring on-campus.
