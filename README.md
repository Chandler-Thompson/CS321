> Plot a course from the parking garage to class, class to lunch, and back to your car again! Maximizing your time usage in between classes and after by cutting through buildings, and avoiding construction zones.

> If new construction pops up, or you simply want to avoid a part of campus, just hold right-click and drag to create a `no-go zone`
